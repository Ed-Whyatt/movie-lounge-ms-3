## Setting up MongoDB Atlas for database use

You will need to go to MonGoDB Atlas and create an accout first, Details on how to do this can be found here: [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/)

1. Once you have loged in navgate click to create a cluster.
2. Select a clound service aws is free and used for this database.
3. Select the region that is nearest to you e.g Europe (Ireland).
4. Select cluster Tier M0 has been used for this site and is free.
5. Scroll down to the bottom and choose a cluster name e.g. movielounge, This will be used in your own env.py with your own vars and keys witch will never be stored in your git hub repo.
6. Then click on create cluster. This will take a few minits to create your Database and take you to your database page.
7. Click on Database Access, Then Add New Database User.
8. Create a new user and password do not use non-alphanumeric characters (e.g.: ?, %,@ or &) in your username or password! Make sure your user privileges are set to Read and Write to any database.
9. Then click add user.
10. Next click on Network Access and add the IP address you will use to access your database.
10, Click on clusters tab and select your cluster e.g. My First Cluster.
11. Then select collections tab and click on Add My Own Data.
12. Fill out the new database name e.g Database name - myFirstDB , Collection name - movies, questions and ancers. Then click create.
13. Once you have created the databases click on insert document and fill in the details for each database. The databases for the three mongo database documents used for this project are:
### - answers
![text](/documentation/mongo-db-documents-images/answers.png)
### - questions

## Setting up Flask Development env.py file with vars and keys for mongo database, prosgres database and omdb api wrapper.

1. First navigate to [http://www.omdbapi.com/](http://www.omdbapi.com/) select the api key tab and fill in the form to recive your ondb via email. this will go in the env.py file shown in step 7.
2. Open the terminal in your gitpod workspace.
3. To istall the framworks to work with progress database and omdb wrapper type in the terminal:
```bash
pip3 install Flask-SQLAlchemy psycopg2 omdb
```
4. Next, we will be storing some sensitive data, and we need to hide them using environment variables hidden within a new file called 'env.py'.
5. Create a new env.py in the terminal by typeing:
```bash
touch env.py
```
6. Make sure yo have a '.gitignore' if not create one and that env.py is in the list so that this will not be pushed to your git hub repo.
```bash
touch .gitignore
```
7. Within your env.py file put in the following with your relevent keys information.
```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "e.g. 0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "e.g. 5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "your_own_secret_key")
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "postgresql:/// name of your database here ")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", " name of your mongo uri here")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", " your mongo database name")
os.environ.setdefault("API_KEY", " your omdb key here ")
```
9. Next create a folder for your app e.g. movielounge and within that folder create a ```__init__.py``` This will make sure to initialize our taskmanager application as a package, allowing us to use
our own imports, as well as any standard imports.
```bash
__init__.py
```
10. 
- Now we can create an instance of the imported Flask() class, and that will be stored in
a variable called 'app', which takes the default Flask __name__ module.
Then, we need to specify two app configuration variables, and these will both come from our environment variables.
app.config SECRET_KEY and app.config SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI, both wrapped in square brackets and quotes.
Each of these will be set to get their respective environment variable, which is SECRET_KEY,
and the short and sweet DB_URL for the database location which we'll set up later.
Then, we need to create an instance of the imported SQLAlchemy() class, which will be
assigned to a variable of 'db', and set to the instance of our Flask 'app'.

- Finally, from our movielounge package, we will be importing a file called 'routes' which is allready create in the movie-lounge-ms-3 repo. 
- Within your ```__init__.py``` file should look like the following.

```python
import os
import re
from flask import Flask
from flask_pymongo import PyMongo
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from omdb import OMDBClient
if os.path.exists("env.py"):
    import env  # noqa


app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = os.environ.get("DB_URL")
app.config["MONGO_DBNAME"] = os.environ.get("MONGO_DBNAME")
app.config["MONGO_URI"] = os.environ.get("MONGO_URI")
app.config["API_KEY"] = os.environ.get("API_KEY")


db = SQLAlchemy(app)
mongo = PyMongo(app)
api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
client = OMDBClient(apikey=api_key)

from movielounge import routes  # noqa

```
11. Now it's time to create the main Python file that will actually run the entire application.
This will be at the root level of our workspace, not part of the movielounge package itself.
Since it will run the whole application, let's just call it run.py in that case.
```bash
touch run.py
```
12. Use the same details located in the movie-lounge-ms-3 repo run.py file.
```python
import os
from movielounge import app


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(
        host=os.environ.get("IP"),
        port=int(os.environ.get("PORT")),
        debug=os.environ.get("DEBUG")
    )

```
***
Setting up Prosgres local Database
***
Using the models.py file in the movie-lounge-ms-3 repo. This file will create the Users and Categorys in the posgress database.
- models.py file
```python
from movielounge import db


class Category(db.Model):
    # schema for the Category model
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    category_name = db.Column(db.String(30), unique=True, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        # __repr__ to represent itself in the form of a string
        return self.category_name


class Users(db.Model):
    # schema for the Task model
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_name = db.Column(db.String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(260), nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        # __repr__ to represent itself in the form of a string
        return self.user_name
```
1. Open the terminal in your gitpod workspace and type the following and hit enter.
```bash
set_pg
```
2. Then
```bash
psql
```
You should see the follwing:
```psql
psql (12.12 (Ubuntu 12.12-1.pgdg20.04+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
```
3. To create the database type the follwing and hit enter:
```psql
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE movielounge;
```
4. To check it has worked type
```psql
postgres=# \c movielounge;
```
- You should now see the new psql movielounge database in the cli as follows.
```psql
movielounge=#
```
5. Now exit psql cli by typing \q and hit enter.
```psql 
movielounge=#\q
```
6. Next, we need to use Python to generate and migrate our models into this new database.
This will take the models that we've created for Category and Users, and build the database schema using the details we've provided.
By typing python3 enter in the gitpod workspace terminal.
```bash
python3
```
- you shold now be in the python interpreter
```psql
Python 3.8.11 (default, Sep  7 2022, 11:13:18) 
[GCC 9.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
````
7. From here, we need to import our 'db' variable found within the movielounge package, so type:
from movielounge import db
```psql
Python 3.8.11 (default, Sep  7 2022, 11:13:18) 
[GCC 9.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from movielounge import db
````
8. Now, using db, we need to perform the .create_all() method:
```psql
Python 3.8.11 (default, Sep  7 2022, 11:13:18) 
[GCC 9.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from movielounge import db
>>> db.create_all()
````
9. That's it, pretty simple enough, our Postgres database should be populated with these two tables and their respective columns and relationships.
10. Type exit() to exit the python interpreter.
```psql
>>> exit()
````
11. Finaly to check everything worked you can check the psql movielounge by typing.
```psql
psql -d movielounge
```
- Then type
```psql
\dt
```
- You should see the tables and there relevent collums.
```psql
psql (12.12 (Ubuntu 12.12-1.pgdg20.04+1))
Type "help" for help.
movielounge-# \dt
         List of relations
 Schema |   Name   | Type  | Owner  
--------+----------+-------+--------
 public | category | table | gitpod
 public | users    | table | gitpod
(2 rows)

movielounge-# 
```
